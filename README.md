# FIRM-LOG-FINANCIAL-ANALYSIS-DASHBORAD
Tableau Dashboard analyzing firm Financial year analysis P&L
When I first started in finance, being an Electrical Engineer, I thought reports were just about numbers. But over time, I realized: numbers only make sense when they tell a story.
So, I designed a Financial Analysis Dashboard that does exactly that—translating raw data into clear insights.
✅ Profit & Loss tracking
✅ Expense & revenue breakdown
✅ Forecasts & variances
✅ Priorities
This dashboard gives management the clarity to make smarter, faster decisions.
Proud of how far I’ve come in combining finance + data visualization to create impact. And this is just the beginning 🚀
